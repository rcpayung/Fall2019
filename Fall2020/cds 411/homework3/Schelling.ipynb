    "In a 2D simulation, each cell has 8 neighbors (excluding those along the perimeter of the environment).  Consider a 3D environment which has 100 cells in the vertical dimension, 100 cells in the horizontal dimension, and 100 cells in the depth dimension.  How many neighbors does a cell have in 3D?  How many neighbors does a cell in 4D and 5D have?"

NOTE: This is true for any point except for edges. Now, if we wanted to find the total neighbors, we multiply by the number of elements in the matricies. (A 5-dimensional matrix would have a very large amount of neighbors)."
