**DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE**

This repository exists as a location for all of my coursework that I have completed at George Mason University during the 2016-2020 school years. Please note that coursework
from 2016 and 2017 may not be available to me any longer, that is why it is unavailable on this repository. Thank you for your understanding.
